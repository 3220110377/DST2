# DST2 Magic Tower Game

## Project Overview
This is a text-based adventure game developed as an assignment for the DST2 course during my sophomore year. The game is implemented in Java and features a classic dungeon exploration mechanic with additional custom elements. The project was completed on November 20, 2023.

## Game Description
The game is designed as a text-based adventure where players navigate through a castle, solve puzzles, and progress through different stages. Key features include:

### Core Mechanics
- **Exploration**: Players can explore each room to uncover hidden clues and items by using the `search` command.
- **Key and Sword System**: A locked room contains a sword that is essential for defeating the boss. Players must find a key to access this room.
- **Boss Battle**: Players without the sword will be defeated by the boss, ending the game. With the sword, players can defeat the boss and rescue the princess, advancing to the next stage.
- **Hidden Rooms**: Certain rooms are only revealed after triggering a mechanism through exploration.
- **Narrative Elements**: Background stories of the castle are scattered throughout various rooms, accessible through exploration.

### Game Stages
- **Stage 1**: Players explore the castle, find the key, retrieve the sword, and defeat the boss to rescue the princess.
- **Stage 2**: After defeating the boss, players must escape the castle. The boss seals the exit, and players need to find a magical scroll to break the seal. Meanwhile, enemies lurk in hidden rooms, adding tension to the escape.

## Technical Implementation
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA
- **Requirements**: Java SE 8 or higher
